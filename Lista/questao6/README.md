## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.![Captura de tela 2024-03-16 150939](https://github.com/mms-11/Java_Cin/assets/140762703/39abc03b-89c4-4f54-88c5-fb15aa9d4433)


> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
